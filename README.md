# Max-Flow-and-Min-Cut-Analysis-for-Urban-Water-Networks

This project models water distribution efficiency in Pune using graph-based network flow algorithms. It applies the Max Flow Min Cut theory to simulate supply capacity, bottlenecks, leakage effects, and pipe failures in an urban water system.

The tool provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard that allows users to compare algorithms, visualize the flow, and evaluate the stability of the water pipeline network under different operational scenarios.
